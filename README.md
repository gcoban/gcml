GCML is a mini “Machine Learning Framework” that can be helpful to the students who are interested in Machine Learning. The algorithms are implemented mostly through the textbook referenced below.

I had coded GCML mainly during my Machine Learning course given by Zehra Çataltepe to the MSc students in Fall 2013. I will be adding new algorithms according to my study and I will try to keep it simple as possible.

Anyone can contribute it by the help of pull requests or can ask questions to me via mail@gcoban.com
